<h2> About Me </h2>

<p>My name is Iris, a 24-year-old female from Vietnam with a Chinese family background. I am fluent in my native languages in Vietnamese and Cantonese as well as English. I came to Canada back in August 2013 with a letter of acceptance to Sheridan College and a student visa. As such, my primary reason to come to Canada was to study. However, as time passed, I started to embrace and love the multiculturalism and the unique life styles that people have. Canada is truly a unique place that allows various cultures to intertwine and prosper. After two years of studying, I graduated and successfully obtained a work visa by December 2015. I worked as a full-time Early Childcare Support with a primary responsibility to provide care to a set of young two and half year-old twins. Throughout this one-year contract, I have gained immense knowledge in providing care while utilizing the skills that I learned when I was in college. This allowed me to reinforce the concepts and techniques in my classes. The reason I applied to this program is because I want to further myself in education regarding technology support. I am already well-versed in providing support for people and would like to augment this skill-set to the area of technology. I believe technology is an ever-growing field and having a good baseline in this area is a necessity in today s society.</p>
